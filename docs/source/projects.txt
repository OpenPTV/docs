Research projects using OpenPTV
===============================

+ Advection and diffusion processes of complex-nozzle jet flows `[Link] <http://chamorro.mechse.illinois.edu/3d.htm>`_
+ Agglomerate breakage in turbulence [MISSING LINK]
+ Experimental analysis of aortic flow in human aorta [MISSING LINK]
+ Experimental study of turbulent entrainment in swirling jet [MISSING LINK]
+ Velocity derivatives in turbulent flow from 3D-PTV measurements
+ JET growth motion in aerosols module observed under micro-gravity conditions on the sounding rocket MASER 8
+ Anaglyph display of a portion of a velocity field determined by 3-D PTV (use red/blue glasses for stereo-viewing)
+ Study on the applicability of 3-D PTV to surface tension driven convection (Marangoni convection) 
+ Study on the applicability of 3-D PTV for measurements in liquid columns (joined project with ESA-ESTEC and Alenia Aerospazio)
+ 2-D projection of a 3-D trajectory field in a vortex measured with 3-D PTV
